Lightning Decoder is a utility app that helps with understanding the individual parts of a Lightning Network Invoice/Payment Request (BOLT11s) and any [LNURL](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc) request codes. It aims to be a tool for developers building applications on top of the LN network.

## Installing & Developing

To run this application locally, simply clone the repo and run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all dependencies. You should then be able to run `yarn start` or `npm start` to spin up a local development server.

## Building for Production

To build the assets for production, use script `yarn build` or `npm run build`. A `/build` top-level folder will be created, hosting all of the necessary files and assets bundled for serving in production.

## Contributions

I'm always aiming to introduce new features and improvements to the application. If you see a need and would like to contribute, please send a PR with detailed descriptions and I'll evaluate as early as I can.
